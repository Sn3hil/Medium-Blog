**Use new instance per request setup

Prisma with Accelerate is designed to handle connection pooling efficiently, so creating new instances is usually fine and much safer 
in the Workers environment.



**The Real Problem

The issue is with the module-level variable globalPrisma in a V8 isolate environment. Here's what's happening:


V8 Isolate Module State Issues

Module Reloading: V8 isolates can reload modules between requests or isolate restarts. Your globalPrisma variable 
might get reset to null unexpectedly.
Isolate Lifecycle: When a new isolate spins up (which happens frequently in Cloudflare Workers), your module gets
re-executed, and globalPrisma starts as null again.
Accelerate Connection State: Prisma Accelerate maintains connection state that doesn't survive isolate restarts. 
When your module reloads, the previous connection is lost.

The Timing Issue

When your middleware calls getPrisma():

If it's a fresh isolate, globalPrisma is null
A new client gets created with $extends(withAccelerate())
The Accelerate connection needs time to establish
But your route might execute before the connection is ready


**Why Single File Works

In a single file, everything executes in the same module context at the same time. The Prisma client creation and 
usage happen synchronously within the same execution flow, so the Accelerate connection is established before you try to use it.

The V8 Isolate Difference
Unlike Node.js where modules stay loaded and variables persist, V8 isolates are more aggressive about:

Garbage collecting unused modules
Restarting isolates for memory management
Losing module-level state between requests

Your singleton pattern is correct, but V8 isolates don't guarantee that module-level variables will persist the way you expect them to.
The globalPrisma variable can become null again even after being set, causing new client instances to be created when you don't expect it.
This is why many Cloudflare Workers developers end up putting everything in one file - it avoids these module state persistence issues entirely.

**Why you shouldn't use singleton setup in cloudflare environment

Singleton setups in Cloudflare Workers create several serious problems:

Isolate Unpredictability: Workers use an isolate-based architecture where your code might run in different isolates for different requests.
Your singleton variable gets reset to null unpredictably, so you end up creating new instances anyway, defeating the singleton purpose entirely.
Shared State Contamination: Multiple concurrent requests might share the same database connection, leading to overlapping transactions, race 
conditions, and data corruption. One request's database operations can interfere with another's.

Memory Accumulation: Connections that don't get properly cleaned up between requests pile up in memory. Since isolates can persist for a while,
these leaked connections gradually consume available resources.

Error State Persistence: If one request causes the singleton connection to enter an error state, subsequent requests inherit that broken connection.
The error persists across multiple requests until the isolate is recycled.

Debugging Nightmares: Inconsistent behavior makes issues extremely hard to reproduce and debug. Sometimes your singleton works, sometimes it doesn't, 
depending on isolate lifecycle timing.

Connection Pool Exhaustion: Database connections have limits. A singleton that doesn't properly manage its connection can exhaust the pool, causing 
subsequent requests to fail with connection errors.

Stale Connection Issues: Long-lived connections can become stale or timeout, but your singleton might keep trying to use them, leading to mysterious failures.

Concurrency Violations: Database clients often aren't designed for concurrent use across multiple request contexts, leading to internal state corruption within the client itself.

The fundamental issue is that Cloudflare Workers' execution model doesn't guarantee the persistence or isolation that traditional singleton patterns rely on.
